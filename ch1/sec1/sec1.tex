\subsection{Introduction}

The chapter begins with the discussion of the irrationality of
$\sqrt{2}$, namely that there is no rational solution to the
equation $p^2 = 2$.

\begin{defn}
    Let $a$ be an integer. We say that $a$ is \textit{even}
    if there exists an integer $k$ such that $a = 2k$.
    Similiarly, we say that $a$ is \textit{odd}
    if there exists an integer $k$ such that $a = 2k + 1$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
    \label{lem:1}
    The product of two integers is even if and only if one of
    them is even.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

    The proof of this lemma is left to the reader. \qedhere

\begin{thm}[The Irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$]
    There is no rational $p$ such that $p^2 = 2$.
\end{thm}
% Same as previously, contents elided for brevity
\begin{proof}
    Suppose, by way of contradiction, there exists $p \in \bbQ$ such that
    \begin{align}
        p^2 = 2 \label{eq:1}
    \end{align}
    Since $p \in \bbQ$, then there exists integers $m, n$ such that
    $$p = \frac{m}{n}$$ where, without loss of generality,
    $m$ and $n$ are not both even.

    From the following and~\eqref{eq:1}, we see that
    \begin{align}
        m^2 = 2n^2. \label{eq:2}
    \end{align}
    Thus, by definition $m^2$ is even and therefore
    $m$ is even by Lemma~\ref{lem:1}.
    Then, by definition, there exists a integer $q$ 
    such that $m = 2q$. Therefore, we see that
    equation~\eqref{eq:2} becomes
    \begin{align}
        m^2 = (2q)^2 = 4q^2 = 2n^2 \label{eq:3}
    \end{align} which implies that
    \begin{align}
        n^2 = 2q^2. \label{eq:4}
    \end{align}
    Furthermore, $n$ must also be even using the same
    reasoning for $m$. This contradictions our assumption that both
    $m$ and $n$ are not both even.

    Thus, we conclude that there is no rational number $p$
    that satisfies the equation $p^2 = 2$\qedhere
